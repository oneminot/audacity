<a name="audioio"></a>

<p class=qy>Audio I/O</p>

<ul>
<li>The first control or set of controls in this pane is where you configure
    which device <b>Audacity</b> should use for sound input and output.  For
    example, some people might have two sound cards, and they want to select
    which one to use.  Some computers have a built-in microphone, and this is
    also where you'd select whether you want to record from there or from
    the line-in jack on your sound card.  No need to adjust this if <b>Audacity</b>
    is already playing to and recording from the correct place.<p>

<li><b>Record in Stereo</b>: If this is checked, recordings you make in
    Audacity will be stereo, otherwise they will be monaural.  Note that
    the interpretation of mono recordings depends on your system - on most
    systems making a mono recording of a stereo input will result in the
    two channels being mixed, but on other systems it could give you just
    the left channel, for example.

<li><b>Play other tracks while recording new one</b>:
    Check this box if you want to record
    multiple tracks over top of one another!  Record the first track as
    usual.  Then, with this box checked, click record again.  The first
    track you recorded will play, but <b>Audacity</b> will also record a
    new track at the same time, maybe allowing you to sing harmony with
    yourself or add realtime sound effects to a recording.
    <br>
    You may notice that when you play the two tracks you recorded
    together, they aren't synchronized.  This is normal and is not the
    fault of <b>Audacity</b>.  To fix it, you will need to grab the
    <a href="toolbar.html#timeshift">Time Shift</a> tool and slide one
    of the tracks around until it sounds right.    
    <br>
    Note that this is not the same as <b>playthrough</b>, which means
    having the computer play the track that you are currently recording,
    as you are recording it.  You may be able to enable this using your
    operating system's Mixer, but Audacity cannot enable this directly.
</ul>


<a name="quality"></a>
<p class=qy>Quality</p>

<p class=a>This panel sets the default sample rate and bit depth for new projects.
   It does not affect any existing project - to change the sample rate of an existing
   project, just click on the rate at the bottom of the window and select
   a new rate from the pop-up menu.</p>
<p class=a>The bit depth affects imported material, if it's copied, as well as newly recorded
   material. The advantage of the 32-bit float resolution is that effects return material at
   a this resolution, which improves the final mix, because the computer has more precise material
   to work with.</p>


<a name="fileform"></a>
<p class=qy>File Formats</b> 

<ul>
<li><b>When importing uncompressed audio files...</b>

   <ul>
   <li>Make a copy of the file to edit: selecting this means that
       <b>Audacity</b> will run a little bit slower, but it will
       always have its own copy of any audio you are using in a
       project.  You can move, change, or throw away your files
       immediately after you open or import them into Audacity.

   <li>Edit the original in place: selecting this operation means
       that <b>Audacity</b> depends on your original audio files
       being there, and only stores changes you make to these
       files.  If you move, change, or throw away one of the files
       you imported into <b>Audacity</b>, your project may become
       unusable.  However, because <b>Audacity</b> doesn't need to
       make copies of everything, it can import files much more
       quickly this way.
   </ul>

<li><b>Uncompressed Export Format</b>: This lets you select the
    format that Audacity will use when you export uncompressed
    files, i.e. anything other than lossy formats, such as OGG and MP3.
    Audacity can output a huge amount of different formats with the
    <i>Other</i> option, which lets you define any aspect of the
    multitude of different formats.

<li><b>Ogg Export Setup</b>: Use this control to set the
    quality of Ogg Vorbis exporting.  Ogg Vorbis is a compressed
    audio format similar to MP3, but free of patents and
    licensing fees.  A normal quality Ogg Vorbis file is
    encoded with a quality setting of "5".  Note that unlike
    MP3 encoding, Ogg Vorbis does not let you set a bitrate,
    because some audio clips are easier to compress than
    others.  Increasing the quality will always increase the
    file size, however.

<li><b>MP3 Export Setup</b>: Use these controls to locate your
    MP3 encoder and set the quality of MP3 encoding.  Higher
    quality files take up more space, so you will need to find
    the level of quality you feel is the best compromise.
    For more information, see
    <a href="exportmp3.html">Exporting MP3 Files</a>.

</ul>



<a name="spectrograms"></a>

<p class=qy>Spectrograms</p>

<p class=a>You can view any audio track as a Spectrogram instead of a
   Waveform by selecting one of the Spectral views from the
   track's pop-up menu.  This dialog lets you adjust some of
   the settings for these spectrograms.

<ul>
<li><b>FFT Size:</b> The size of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
    affects how much vertical (frequency) detail you see.  Larger
    FFT sizes give you more bass resolution and less temporal
    resolution, and they are slower. 

<li><b>Grayscale</b>: Select this for gray spectrograms instead of
    colored ones.

<li><b>Maximum Frequency</b>: Set this value anywhere from a couple
    of hundred hertz to half the sample rate (i.e. 22050 Hz if the
    sample rate is 44100 Hz).  For some applications, such as speech
    recognition or pitch extraction, very high frequencies are not
    important (visually), so this allows you to hide these and only
    focus on the ones you care about.
</ul>
</p>


<a name="directories"></a>
<p class=qy>Directories</p>

<p class=a>Use this panel to set the location of Audacity's temporary
   directory.  Audacity uses this directory whenever you work on
   a project that you haven't saved as an Audacity Project
   (AUP file) yet.
   You have to restart Audacity (close and open it again) for
   changes to the temporary directory to take effect.
</p>

<a name="interface"></a>

<p class=qy>Interface</p>
   <ul>
     <li><B>Autoscroll while playing</B><br>
       Pageflips to the right when the cursor travels to the right end of the wave display, either during playback or recording.
     <li><B>Update Spectrogram while playing</B><br>
       Tries to keep the spectrogram updated while playing. This requires a lot of CPU power, and realy isn't a good idea unless you're
       playing a realy small piece. In combination with <i>Autoscroll while playing</i> this can cause pauses during playback.
     <li><B>Enable Edit Toolbar</B><br>
       Gives you a toolbar of a few useful functions. Check out the page on the <a href="toolbar_edit.html">Edit Toolbar</a> for more information.
     <li><B>Language</B><br>
       Lets you change the language of the menus and other onscreen text to the language of your choice, if you realy
       have to change it again after picking your language when Audacity started the first time. Simply enter the right
       language code, close and restart Audacity. Check the language directory in the installation direcory to see what
       languages are available to you.
   </ul>

<a name="keyboard"></a>

<p class=qy>Keyboard</p>
   <ul>
     <li><B>Commands/Key Combination List</B><br>
       All commands in Audacity that can be triggered by a keyboard shortcut is listed here.
       Click on the shortcut and the assigned shortcut is highlighted in the command/shortcut list.
       Click on the "Clear" button to erase the shortcut assigned to the function selected in the
       Commands column.
     <li><B>Adding new shortcuts/changing shortcuts</B><br>
       Click on the command in the list.
       Click in to the field next to the "Set" button and press any key
       or combination of command key(Shift,CTRL,ALT) and alphanumeric key(everything else).
       The description of that key or key combo will appear in the field or replace the shortcut.
       By clicking on the "Set" button, you can add or change this key or key combo
       as a shortcut to the function selected in the Commands list.
   </ul>
<p class=a>Head over to <a href="keyboard_shortcuts_create.html">this page</a>
 for step-by-step description of the dialog and how to edit the command/keyboard combination list
 with a text editor.
