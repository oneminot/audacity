<h1>Analyze Menu</h1>
</font>

The Analyze menu is intended for effects and plug-in effects that
do not modify the audio, but simply open a dialog with some
descriptive information.  Audacity also supports Analyze commands that
create annotations in a <a href="track_label.htm">Label Track</a>.

<br><p>

Audacity does not come with any built-in Analyze commands, so
anything in this menu must be a plug-in.  It is possible for a
poorly written plug-in to crash Audacity, so always save your work
before using a plug-in.
