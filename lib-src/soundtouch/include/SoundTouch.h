/*****************************************************************************
 *
 * A main class for tempo/pitch/rate adjusting routines. 
 *
 * Initialize the object by setting up the sound stream parameters with the
 * 'setSampleRate' and 'setChannels' functions, and set the desired
 * tempo/pitch/rate settings with the corresponding functions.
 *
 * Notes:
 * * This class behaves like an first-in-first-out pipe: The samples to be 
 *  processed are fed into one of the pipe with the 'putSamples' function,
 *  and the ready, processed samples are read from the other end with the 
 *  'receiveSamples' function. 
 *
 * * The tempo/pitch/rate control parameters may freely be altered during 
 * processing.
 *
 * * The processing routines introduce a certain 'latency' between the
 * input and output, so that the inputted samples aren't immediately 
 * transferred to the output, and neither the number of output samples 
 * immediately available after inputting some samples isn't in direct 
 * relationship to the number of previously inputted samples.
 *
 * * This class utilizes classes 'tempochanger' to change tempo of the
 * sound (without changing pitch) and 'transposer' to change rate
 * (that is, both tempo and pitch) of the sound. The third available control 
 * 'pitch' (change pitch but maintain tempo) is produced by suitably 
 * combining the two preceding controls.
