   v1.01:

     the FIFOSampleBuffer class from external files.

Acknowledgements
================

Many thanks to Stuart Lamble for translating the MMX optimizations from
MS Visual C++ syntax into gcc syntax for joy of all Linux users.

Thanks also to Manish Bajpai, whose WAV file reading routines I've used
as base of the WavInFile & WavOutFile classes, that are being used in 
the soundstrecth program for accessing WAV audio files.
